# HavanaBeachDeepLearning

For our homework assignment we chose to make a Generative Adversarial Network. Our main goal is to generate pokemons, based on the following dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/kvpratama/pokemon-images-dataset/data. As a possible improvement we would try to make a network that is able to generate pokemons based on drawings, by users.

As we are making a GAN we don't need training and validation set for the images. Also we don't need preprocessing, because than the images would need to be transformed in the results as well.

To run the .ipynb file it should be in the same folder as the "pokemon" folder, which contains the images.
